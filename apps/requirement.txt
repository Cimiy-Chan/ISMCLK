- To disable pylint, select View->Command Palette ->Type 'Python' -> Pylint -> disable,
then exist VS code and reload the VS code

- Hash method (if need):

y = fernet.decrypt(pw).decode()

For making the distribution executable
0. Install the PC application NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System 3.08 or above)
1. Install pyinstaller by using Powershell C:> pip install pyinstaller
1a. Change directory to c:\uidmt\apps
2. C: > pyinstaller -F -w c:\uidmt\apps\uidmt_main.py (Before running it, make sure the older OPTG_main.exe not in the ...\dist)
3. The OPTG_main.exe is located at C:\user\user_name\dist
3A. The OPTG_main.exe is located at C:\PACAS\apps\dist
4. Create a new folder: say: c:\uidmt_dist for making distribtion executable
5. Move all necessary files and folder to this folders (Note: DO NOT add any source codes to this folder)
6. Also move the uidmt_main.exe into C:\uidmt_dist\apps
7. Zip all the files and folders into a zipped file and named it as 'uidmt_setup.zip'
8. Launch NSIS application, select Compiler - 'Installer based on .ZIP file' (left-top corner)
9. Open the zip file
10. Installer Name: UIDMT Installation, Interface=Modern, Default Folder: c:\uidmt
11: Output EXE file: c:\UIDMT_Dist\uidmt_setup.exe, Compression=LZMA
12: When finished, the distributed executable will be located at c:\pacas_dist\PACAS_Setup.exe
